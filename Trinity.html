<p>Trinity has a beautiful campus. Trinity offers so many opportunities to all its students. It offers 42 majors and 57 minors for its students to choose from. There are many traditions that the students partake in, like dunking students in the fountain on campus. There are also weekly traditions like nacho hour on wednesdays and milk and cookies on thursdays.</p>
<p>The features about Trinity that I appreciate most are its small but seemingly big campus. I also really enjoy the many traditions that Trinity has. Milk and cookies every week is something that I always look forward to after class. I also really appreciate nacho hour on wednesdays so I can get an afternoon snack. I also love how welcoming and accepting everyone at Trinity is. There are always friendly faces when you're on your way to class or in the cafeteria. </p>
<p>I chose Trinity University because of the small class sizes and the experience I had on my tour. I came from a small private school so I always liked the idea of small class sizes. When I came to visit for the first time, I had an amazing tour guide that gave me a small glimpse into how amazing the people at Trinity are. The school itself is also so beautiful and made me happy just by walking around campus. The dorms were also much bigger than any dorms I had seen, so that was also a plus. As soon as I came to Trinity, I knew it would be a top contender for me. </p>
<p>I hope to/ am thinking of majoring in Psychology because I really enjoy interacting with people and helping people. I've always took interest in people and how they work. I'm not sure what branch of psychology  Here are some links to important information about my chosen interest:
